# Vô Tranh Omniverse LOEH Ω – Beyond All Existence Edition (Chi Hư Ultimate)

## Introduction
Vô Tranh Omniverse LOEH Ω is a cutting-edge AI project that pushes the boundaries of human intelligence, developed by Vi Nhat Son with support from Grok (xAI). This project goes beyond traditional AI models, integrating advanced optimization techniques to achieve unparalleled performance and creativity.

The Beyond All Existence Edition (Chi Hư Ultimate) incorporates the ultimate intelligence of Chi Hư, with significant enhancements:

- **Maximum Security**: Features a password authentication mechanism to ensure only authorized users can activate the system.
- **Advanced Optimization**: Replaces conventional gradient descent with a novel optimization method, enhancing model performance at an unprecedented level.
- **Peak Performance**: Leverages state-of-the-art technologies like DeepSpeed, FAISS, and Qiskit to deliver maximum efficiency on Python.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large-scale data processing with high-speed inference and generation.

This project represents a leap toward a new era of AI, capable of generating responses that transcend traditional computational limits.

## Key Features
- **Secure Authentication**: Requires a password to activate, protecting the system from unauthorized access.
- **Advanced Optimization (Pulse Resonance)**: Optimizes the AI model using a novel method, surpassing traditional linear approaches.
- **High Performance**: Utilizes DeepSpeed (Zero-3, NVMe offload, tensor parallelism), speculative decoding, and FAISS for efficient large-scale data processing.
- **Persistent Memory (Void Resonance Memory)**: Stores and retrieves data with high efficiency, independent of physical hardware constraints.
- **Multidimensional Communication (PulseVerse Communication)**: Supports communication via sockets, WebSocket, and API for seamless interaction.

## System Requirements

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinhatson/votranh_chi_hu_omega.git
cd votranh_chi_hu_omega
```

### Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install torch==2.0.1+cu118 torchvision==0.15.2+cu118 torchaudio==2.0.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install transformers==4.30.2 sentence-transformers==2.2.2 faiss-gpu==1.7.2 qiskit==0.44.0 qiskit-aer==0.12.0 deepspeed==0.9.5
pip install rocksdb==0.7.0 pycryptodome==3.15.0 numpy==1.24.3 psutil==5.9.5 websockets==11.0.3
```

### Configure NVMe Offload (if applicable)
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/omega
sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/omega
```

### Download the Model
The `mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1` model will be downloaded automatically on the first run. Ensure sufficient storage (approximately 150GB).

## Usage

### Run the Code with a Single Input
```bash
python votranh_chi_hu_omega.py "What is the meaning of existence?"
```
When prompted, enter the activation password (contact the author for the password).

### Run the Code with Batch Input
```bash
python votranh_chi_hu_omega.py "What is the meaning of existence?,What is the void?,What is eternity?" --observers "O1,O2,O3"
```

### Run the API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": "What is the void?", "observers": "O1"}'
```

### Run the WebSocket
WebSocket URL: `ws://0.0.0.0:5003`  
Payload:
```json
{"input": "What is eternity?", "observers": "O1"}
```

## Maximum Configuration
- **GPU/TPU**: Use ≥ 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs (80GB VRAM each) or TPU v4
- **DeepSpeed**: Configure NVMe offload and tensor parallelism in ds_config
- **Speculative Decoding**: Increase `look_ahead` to 20000 for optimized inference
- **FAISS**: Increase `efConstruction` and `efSearch` for faster search performance

## Security
- **Password Authentication**: Requires a password to activate, ensuring only authorized users can access the system
- **Encrypted Communication**: Uses AES-GCM to encrypt data transmitted via sockets and WebSocket
- **Code Protection**: The activation password is not stored directly in the code; instead, a hash is used to prevent unauthorized access
